## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop an effective botnet detection system using various machine learning models. This includes:
- Preprocessing and analyzing network traffic data.
- Extracting and selecting relevant features.
- Building and tuning machine learning models for classification.
- Evaluating model performance using various metrics.

## Data

The dataset used in this project consists of network traffic data with the following characteristics:
- **Source_Type_of_Service**
- **Destination_Type_of_Service**
- **Duration**
- **Total_Packets**
- **Total_Bytes**
- **Label** (indicating whether the traffic is from a botnet or not)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to understand the data distribution, detect anomalies, and identify patterns. Key steps include:
- Visualizing the distribution of features.
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships between features.
- Plotting distributions of features for suspicious and non-suspicious traffic.

## Feature Engineering and Selection

### Feature Engineering

New features are created to enhance model performance. For instance:
- Transforming categorical features into numerical format.
- Generating interaction features based on domain knowledge.

### Feature Selection

Relevant features are selected using techniques like:
- Correlation analysis.
- Chi-squared test.
- Variance thresholding to remove low variance features.

## Model Building

Several machine learning models are built and trained on the dataset:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

The models are trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance. The following parameters are tuned:
- **Logistic Regression**: `C`, `penalty`
- **Random Forest**: `n_estimators`, `max_depth`
- **SVM**: `C`, `kernel`
- **Decision Tree**: `max_depth`
- **KNN**: `n_neighbors`, `weights`

## Clustering

Clustering techniques like k-means or DBSCAN are applied to identify anomalous traffic patterns in an unsupervised manner. This helps in detecting botnets without labeled data.

## Results and Evaluation

The performance of each model is evaluated based on:
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positive instances among the predicted positives.
- **Recall**: Proportion of true positive instances among the actual positives.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the ROC curve.

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques for botnet detection. By combining feature engineering, model building, and hyperparameter tuning, effective detection systems can be developed.
